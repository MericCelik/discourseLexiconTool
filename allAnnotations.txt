        (129)
      
      The world is changing in some 
      really profound ways and 
      I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the 
      biggest drivers of change, especially when it comes to sustainabilityI 
      think it's reckless to ignore these things, because doing so can 
      jeopardize future long-term returns 
      and here's something 
      that may surprise you: the balance of power to really influence 
      sustainability rests with institutional investors, the large investors 
      like pension funds, foundations and endowmentsbetter-performing 
      than you believe and 
      more important than we can imaginegrowing 
      and agingwe 
      have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the 
      century and 
      we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenishedwe 
      consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished

      that makes them relevant to risk and returnthat 
      makes them relevant to risk and return 
      and they are really 
      complex and they can seem really far off, that the temptation may be to 
      do this: bury our heads in the sand and not think about itthey 
      are really complex and 
      they can seem really far offbury 
      our heads in the sand and 
      not think about itthey 
      look at financial data, metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market 
      share, valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff 
      and these things are 
      fundamental, of course, but they're not enoughEnvironment

      is the measure of sustainability 
      and sustainable 
      investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the 
      investment processIt 
      means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet 
      and it means 
      providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and 
      sustainable outcomesif

      do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job 
      and not all of them 
      see it this wayThey 
      don't have indefinite social obligations 
      and prudent 
      investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainabilityThe

      if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to 
      companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least 
      not exacerbating them and 
      What if we work and save and invest, only to find that the world we 
      retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is nowwork

      the risk to our planet and to our economy

      if it's a big hoax and 
      we create a better world for nothingI 
      like it too and 
      I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issuein 
      which the amputee inserts their residual limb 
      and which connects 
      to the prosthetic ankleIf 
      your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable, you will not use your leg 
      and that is just 
      simply unacceptable in our ageI 
      met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago 
      and he asked me if I 
      knew how to solve this problemhe 
      asked me if I knew how to solve this problem 
      and I said, &quot;No, not 
      yet, but I would love to figure it outI 
      said, &quot;No, not yet, but I would love to figure it out 
      and for my Ph.D. at 
      the MIT Media Lab, I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and 
      cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prosthesesuse 
      finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and 
      strains on the normal forces 
      and create a 
      prosthetic socket for manufactureIt's 
      so soft, it's like walking on pillows 
      and it's effing sexyMy 
      hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our 
      research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to 
      those who need them and 
      For me, a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and 
      disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their 
      bodiesFor me, 
      a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease 
      is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies 
      and Whether it's in 
      Sierra Leone or in Boston, I hope this not only restores but indeed 
      transforms their sense of human potentialThe 
      universe is teeming with planets 
      and I want us, in 
      the next decade, to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an 
      Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor lifeto 
      image an Earth about another star 
      and figure out 
      whether it can harbor lifeAstronomers 
      now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet 
      and they speculate 
      that up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet that might be 
      able to harbor lifeWhy 
      haven't we done that and 
      Why is that hardwe 
      take the Hubble Space Telescope 
      and we turn it aroundwe 
      turn it around and 
      we move it out to the orbit of Marswe 
      are out at the Oort Cloud and 
      we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into 
      where the planet iswe're 
      at Alpha Centauri and 
      the planet is gonethe 
      planet is gone and 
      All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion 
      times brighter than the planetThat's 
      what we want to see and 
      That's why it's hardThe 
      light from the star is diffracting 
      and It's scattering 
      inside the telescope, creating that very bright image that washes out 
      the planetWe 
      have to get rid of it and 
      I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do 
      thatthat I 
      think is the coolest and 
      probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decadeIt 
      was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer in 1962 
      and he took his 
      inspiration from an eclipseThe 
      moon has moved in front of the sun 
      and It blocks out 
      most of the light so we can see that dim corona around itWe 
      put a telescope or a camera in that shadow 
      and we look back at 
      the sunmost 
      of the light's been removed and 
      we can see that dim, fine structure in the coronaWe 
      build a big screen, we fly it in space, we put it up in front of the 
      star, we block out most of the light, we fly a space telescope in that 
      shadow that's created, and boom, we get to see planets 
      and that would look 
      something like thisthere's 
      that big screen and 
      there's no planetsIt's 
      like water bending around a rock in a stream 
      and all that light 
      just destroys the shadowIt's 
      a terrible shadow and 
      we can't see planetsIf 
      we can feather the edges, soften those edges so we can control 
      diffraction, well then we can see a planet 
      and in the last 10 
      years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing thatin 
      the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing 
      that and 
      It looks something like thatIf 
      we make the edges of those petals exactly right 
      and if we control 
      their shapeIf 
      we make the edges of those petals exactly right, if we control their 
      shape, we can control diffraction 
      and now we have a 
      great shadowIt's 
      about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before 
      and we can see the 
      planets beam out just like thatThat 
      starshade is about the size of half a football field 
      and it has to fly 
      50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in 
      its shadowit 
      has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held 
      right in its shadow and 
      then we can see those planetsbrilliant 
      engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL, came up with a fabulous design for 
      how to do that and 
      it looks like thisflip 
      and flyWe 
      ran this test 16 times and 
      16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeterif 
      we can do this and 
      if we can build this technologyif 
      we can build this technology 
      and if we can get it 
      into spaceYou 
      can see Jupiter and 
      you can see Saturn, Uranus, Neptuneyou 
      can see Saturn, Uranus, Neptune 
      and right there in 
      the center, next to the residual light is that pale blue dotI 
      think this is the coolest possible science 
      and That's why I got 
      into doing this, because I think that will change the worldshe 
      had set it out in the trash in her studio 
      and her neighbor had 
      taken itThis 
      is a question I've long asked myself

      six on, I kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked 
      away in the back of a closetThere 
      was a deep restlessness in me, a primal fear that I would fall prey to a 
      life of routine and boredom and 
      many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would 
      walk across borders, forage for berries, and meet all kinds of strange
