846	The world is changing
2149	in some really profound ways,
4861	and I worry that investors
6844	aren't paying enough attention
8578	to some of the biggest drivers of change,
10443	especially when it comes to sustainability.
14219	And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,
17674	like environmental and social issues
19577	and corporate governance.
22086	I think it's reckless to ignore these things,
24352	because doing so can jeopardize
25998	future long-term returns.
28467	And here's something that may surprise you:
30663	the balance of power to really influence sustainability
35334	rests with institutional investors,
37489	the large investors like pension funds,
40525	foundations and endowments.
43481	I believe that sustainable investing
45075	is less complicated than you think,
47725	better-performing than you believe,
49753	and more important than we can imagine.
52626	Let me remind you what we already know.
55634	We have a population that's both growing and aging;
59180	we have seven billion souls today
61026	heading to 10 billion
62452	at the end of the century;
64353	we consume natural resources
66851	faster than they can be replenished;
69677	and the emissions that are mainly responsible
72114	for climate change just keep increasing.
76943	Now clearly, these are environmental and social issues,
81160	but that's not all.
83092	They're economic issues,
85064	and that makes them relevant
86800	to risk and return.
90077	And they are really complex
92157	and they can seem really far off,
93822	that the temptation may be to do this:
97108	bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.
100474	Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.
103124	(Laughter)
105050	But it makes me wonder
106693	if the investment rules of today
108706	are fit for purpose tomorrow.
111951	We know that investors,
113789	when they look at a company and decide whether to invest,
116649	they look at financial data,
118281	metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,
122301	valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.
127713	And these things are fundamental, of course,
130040	but they're not enough.
131805	Investors should also look at performance metrics
134254	in what we call ESG:
136178	environment, social and governance.
139020	Environment includes energy consumption,
143782	water availability, waste and pollution,
149166	just making efficient uses of resources.
152985	Social includes human capital,
155112	things like employee engagement
156980	and innovation capacity,
159324	as well as supply chain management
162636	and labor rights and human rights.
166206	And governance relates to the oversight
168014	of companies by their boards and investors.
171795	See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.
174906	But ESG is the measure of sustainability,
179093	and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors
183234	with financial factors into the investment process.
187351	It means limiting future risk
189479	by minimizing harm to people and planet,
193088	and it means providing capital to users
196703	who deploy it towards productive
198863	and sustainable outcomes.
201587	So if sustainability matters financially today,
204751	and all signs indicate more tomorrow,
207243	is the private sector paying attention?
210741	Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.
216722	They started to see sustainability
218288	not just as important but crucial to business success.
222532	About 80 percent of global CEOs
224946	see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation
229037	and leading to competitive advantage
231430	in their industries.
233154	But 93 percent see ESG as the future,
236327	or as important to the future of their business.
239376	So the views of CEOs are clear.
242593	There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.
245780	So how are companies actually leveraging ESG
249308	to drive hard business results?
252110	One example is near and dear to our hearts.
254631	In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications
258065	to the cloud environment,
259711	and we retired another 85.
262140	We virtualized our operating system environments,
264846	and we completed numerous automation projects.
268309	Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace,
270841	and they reduce our real estate footprint,
273625	and they yield savings of 23 million dollars
276265	in operating costs annually,
279265	and avoid the emissions
281101	of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.
285551	That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars
288584	off the road.
290373	So awesome, right?
293012	Another example is Pentair.
295976	Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,
298305	and about a decade ago,
299885	they sold their core power tools business
302372	and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.
306630	That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?
310593	Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,
313321	there's more growth in water than in power tools,
316243	and this company has their sights set
318165	on what they call "the new New World."
320532	That's four billion middle class people
322915	demanding food, energy and water.
328069	Now, you may be asking yourself,
331193	are these just isolated cases?
332859	I mean, come on, really?
334837	Do companies that take sustainability into account
336846	really do well financially?
339032	The answer that may surprise you is yes.
341878	The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance
345043	perform just as well as others.
348390	In blue, we see the MSCI World.
350664	It's an index of large companies
352101	from developed markets across the world.
354890	And in gold, we see a subset of companies
357362	rated as having the best ESG performance.
360145	Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.
364396	So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.
368807	In some cases, there may be outperformance
371370	from ESG.
373953	In blue, we see the performance
376131	of the 500 largest global companies,
378546	and in gold, we see a subset of companies
381859	with best practice in climate change strategy
384682	and risk management.
386115	Now over almost eight years,
387545	they've outperformed by about two thirds.
390555	So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.
394449	But it does illustrate that environmental leadership
396978	is compatible with good returns.
400051	So if the returns are the same or better
404394	and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?
407505	Are investors, particularly institutional investors,
410636	engaged?
412075	Well, some are,
413952	and a few are really at the vanguard.
417288	Hesta.
418527	Hesta is a retirement fund for health
420774	and community services employees in Australia,
423469	with assets of 22 billion [dollars].
425714	They believe that ESG has the potential
427537	to impact risks and returns,
429605	so incorporating it into the investment process
432897	is core to their duty
435113	to act in the best interest of fund members,
437271	core to their duty.
438957	You gotta love the Aussies, right?
442668	CalPERS is another example.
445176	CalPERS is the pension fund
447197	for public employees in California,
449478	and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],
452194	they are the second largest in the U.S.
454286	and the sixth largest in the world.
456983	Now, they're moving toward 100 percent
458546	sustainable investment
460135	by systematically integrated ESG
462217	across the entire fund.
464966	Why? They believe it's critical
468423	to superior long-term returns, full stop.
472954	In their own words, "long-term value creation
475546	requires the effective management
477586	of three forms of capital:
479728	financial, human, and physical.
484447	This is why we are concerned with ESG."
488306	Now, I do speak to a lot of investors
490714	as part of my job,
492441	and not all of them see it this way.
494735	Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,
498493	so we don't do that here,"
500243	or, "We don't want to use the portfolio
502590	to make policy statements."
505094	The one that just really gets under my skin is,
507960	"If you want to do something about that,
510012	just make money, give the profits to charities."
513475	It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.
517244	I mean, let me clarify something right here.
521267	Companies and investors are not
523872	singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.
526631	They don't have indefinite social obligations,
529019	and prudent investing and finance theory
531792	aren't subordinate to sustainability.
533891	They're compatible.
535547	So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.
540012	But institutional investors
541989	are the x-factor in sustainability.
545155	Why do they hold the key?
547218	The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.
550933	(Laughter)
553619	A lot of it.
556015	I mean, a really lot of it.
557757	The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.
560600	The global bond market, 78 trillion.
563658	That's 133 trillion combined.
568836	That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
571507	That's the world's largest economy.
573726	That's some serious freaking firepower.
577563	So we can reconsider
579612	some of these pressing challenges,
581535	like fresh water, clean air,
584049	feeding 10 billion mouths,
586074	if institutional investors
587751	integrated ESG into investment.
590163	What if they used that firepower
592314	to allocate more of their capital
594358	to companies working the hardest
595771	at solving these challenges
597853	or at least not exacerbating them?
600969	What if we work and save and invest,
605806	only to find that the world we retire into
608439	is more stressed and less secure than it is now?
612165	What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
617037	Now a fair question might be,
619525	what if all this sustainability risk stuff
621421	is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,
625957	something for virtuous consumers
628110	or lifestyle choice?
630066	Well, President John F. Kennedy said something
632805	about this that is just spot on:
636290	"There are risks and costs to a program of action,
640102	but they are far less than the long-range risks
642751	and costs of comfortable inaction."
647366	I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,
650984	but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus,
654619	the odds that it's not completely wrong
657180	are better than the odds
658796	that our house will burn down
660471	or we'll get in a car accident.
662406	Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)
666000	But my point is that we buy insurance
669303	to protect ourselves financially
671286	in case those things happen, right?
674489	So by investing sustainably
676038	we're doing two things.
678257	We're creating insurance,
680415	reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,
684661	and at the same time, in the short term,
686650	we're not sacrificing performance.
689326	[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing?"]
694083	Good, you like it. I like it too.
696199	(Laughter)
697776	f because it pokes fun
699849	at both sides of the climate change issue.
702444	I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.
705788	But what I really like about it
707527	is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,
710456	which is, "Plan for the future,
712525	because that's where you're going to spend
714095	the rest of your life."
716596	Thank you.
718955	(Applause)
